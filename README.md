This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025), implemented in **C**.

The main goal of this project is to showcase the algorithmic thinking behind every problem.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized by year and day. Each day's folder contains the source code and the specific input file.
